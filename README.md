## **The reason for choosing this logo**



The angle bracket symbol was used to express programming and because it is one of <br>the most prominent symbols used in the HTML language used by web developers in particular. <br>that who we will be in the future.

Also, the drawing of the mountain was used to express prominence and strength. <br>I thought of using this symbol because I noticed the studentsâ€™ demand <br>for learning despite the difficulty of the road.

And by merging the two symbols, our logo was born
